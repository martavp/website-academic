I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Wind and Energy Systems at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/person/marta-victoria?id=214968&entity=profile) and I keep a small affiliation at the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering at [Aarhus University](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/marta-victoria%2885c9cc23-6c66-44fa-9cdc-cfceb955cd9b%29.html). My research focuses on the modelling of large-scale energy systems with high renewable penetration paying special attention to the role of solar photovoltaics and the design of resilient energy systems. 

I obtained my BSc and MSc in Aerospace Engineering at the [Technical University of Madrid](https://www.etsiae.upm.es/index.php?id=etsiae&L=1) where I also got my PhD in high-efficiency photovoltaic modules at the [Solar Energy Institute](https://www.ies.upm.es/). 

Currently, I lead the [EXTREMES project](https://dff.dk/en/apply/supported-research/research-leaders/research-leaders-2022/researchleader-30?set_language=en) where we investigate the impact of extreme weather events on energy systems and I implement system modelling to research the role of CO2 capture and conversion technologies within the [NNF CO2 Research Center](https://corc.au.dk/).
Moreover, I participate in the [HYPERFARM project](https://hyperfarm.eu/), where we investigate different Agrivoltaic concepts and I lead Aarhus Universityâ€™s participation in the [AURORA project](https://www.aurora-h2020.eu/au-main/) where we are establishing energy communities at four major technical universities in Europe. In the past, I have participated in the [REINVEST project](https://reinvestproject.eu/) to research alternative transition pathways for Europe and Denmark. 

I am a member of the [Open Energy Modelling Initiative](https://openmod-initiative.org/), which aims to promote openness and transparency in energy system modelling, and I co-develop the open-source energy model [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur).
