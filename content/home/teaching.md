# Courses

At DTU, every Spring semester, I teach the MSc course on [Integrated Energy Grids](https://martavp.github.io/integrated-energy-grids/intro.html).



Previously, at Aarhus University, I have taught courses on [Solar Energy](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/da/course/109481/Solar-Energy), and [Macro-Energy Systems Modelling](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/da/course/121809/Macro-Energy-Systems-Modelling), and [Thermodynamics](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/da/course/104828/Thermodynamics).



I have edited a [textbook on Solar Photovoltaics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780323961059/fundamentals-of-solar-cells-and-photovoltaic-systems-engineering#book-description), which is complemented by an [online repository with updated links relevant to every topic and script-based solutions](https://martavp.github.io/pv-textbook/intro.html) for the problems proposed in every chapter.
