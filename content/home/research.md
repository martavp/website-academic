*This study combines two main novelties. First, we evaluate the European transition path to carbon neutrality when countries want to be energy independent and produce as much energy as they consume, on an annual basis. This self-sufficiency constraint only increases total system cost by 5%, but for some countries, such as Germany, the cost can increase by 50%. Second, we model alternative solar photovoltaic configurations, such as different AC/DC ratios for inverters and horizontal single-axis tracking and found that they are beneficial enough to be part of the optimal solution for many countries.*

*Macro-energy system models typically use one or a few years to determine the optimal capacities and dispatch of generation and transmission assets. Here, we used 60 years of historical weather data to design a sector-coupled climate-neutral European energy system. We found that layouts designed for years with compound weather events prove more robust, achieving a resource adequacy of 99.9% when evaluated on different weather years. This highlights the need to consider multi-decadal weather variability in future infrastructure planning*.

*In this study, for the first time, the European energy system is modelled in a network of 181 nodes and comprises the power, heating, land transport, shipping, aviation, and industrial sectors, as well as detailed carbon management. This is the reference paper for the full sector-coupled version of the open model PyPSA-Eur.  We found that building a H2 network, mostly by retrofitting the existing methane network, could reduce system cost by 3.4%, while the alternative strategy of extending the power transmission network could system reduce cost by 8.1%.*
