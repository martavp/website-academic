*This study combines two main novelties. First, we evaluate the European transition path to carbon neutrality when countries want to be energy independent and produce as much energy as they consume, on an annual basis. This self-sufficiency constraint only increases total system cost by 5%, but for some countries, such as Germany, the cost can increase by 50%. Second, we model alternative solar photovoltaic configurations, such as different AC/DC ratios for inverters and horizontal single-axis tracking and found that they are beneficial enough to be part of the optimal solution for many countries.*

*Macro-energy system models typically use one or a few years to determine the optimal capacities and dispatch of generation and transmission assets. Here, we used 60 years of historical weather data to design a sector-coupled climate-neutral European energy system. We found that layouts designed for years with compound weather events prove more robust, achieving a resource adequacy of 99.9% when evaluated on different weather years. This highlights the need to consider multi-decadal weather variability in future infrastructure planning*.

*In this study, for the first time, the European energy system is modelled in a network of 181 nodes and comprises the power, heating, land transport, shipping, aviation, and industrial sectors, as well as detailed carbon management. This is the reference paper for the full sector-coupled version of the open model PyPSA-Eur.  We found that building a H2 network, mostly by retrofitting the existing methane network, could reduce system cost by 3.4%, while the alternative strategy of extending the power transmission network could system reduce cost by 8.1%.*

*Most macro-energy system analyses focus on a target future year but miss the representation of the transformation pathways and their myopic nature (i.e. the need to deal with legacy energy infrastructure from previous planning horizons). In this study, we include a detailed representation of power, heating, transport and industrial sectors together with modelling the myopic transition pathways from 2020 to 2050 using 5-year planning horizons and different climate targets. This is the reference paper for the myopic approach of the open model PyPSA-Eur.*

*Climate change will impact renewable resources, with hydropower being the most affected in Europe. In this study, we evaluate changes in hydropower inflow in Europe at the end of the century under different global warming scenarios, using 2 global circulation models and 3 regional climate models. Northern countries, like Norway, experience large changes in seasonal patterns of inflow due to reduced ice formation. Mediterranean countries like Spain experience a notable reduction in annual inflow. Although inter-model uncertainity is large, the climate signal is robust for most European countries.*

Most Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) have underestimated the role that solar PV can play in future low-carbon energy systems. This is critical as IAMs results constitute the main scenarios included in the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In this review, we discuss the main reasons behind the underestimation of solar PV and compare IAMs results with those provided by energy models using high spatial and temporal resolution. We include a call for action for improving IAMs and changing the paradigm regarding the role that solar PV can play in mitigating climate change. We also identify the challenges for a sustained scaling up of solar PV in the next decade and provide recommendations.

*Near-optimal solutions, whose cost is slightly higher than the optimum, can allow for very different system configurations with additional benefits (e.g., increased robustness or social acceptance). This study presents a new methodology to map the polyhedron representing the space of near-optimal solutions in an energy system optimization problem. First, the boundaries of the polyhedron are determined by successively expanding the volume in directions that increase the capacity of different technologies while only producing an epsilon increase in the system cost. Second, the bounded volume is efficiently sampled to identify thousands of near-optimal solutions. The method is applied to the European power system.*

*Transition paths are traditionally analysed using coarse models with annual resolution and neglecting transmission grids, while power system models with detailed network representation miss other sectors and the existence of a limited carbon budget. In this work, we combine the two approaches to unveil two significant results. First, we show that it is cost-effective to use solar photovoltaics and wind as the cornerstone of a future decarbonised European Energy system. This contradicts the traditional energy transition narrative that comprises mostly scenarios requiring a significant contribution from biomass and/or nuclear. Second, the myopic modelling approach enabled us to identify that following an early and steady path in which emissions are strongly reduced in the first decade is more cost-effective than following a late and rapid path in which low initial reduction targets quickly deplete the carbon budget and require a sharp reduction later.*

*The analysis included in this paper overcomes the previous common understanding (“storage is needed in highly renewable energy systems”) by showing the emergence of two different kinds of storage technologies and the requirement to combine both to ensure the feasible operation of the system. The two storage technologies show fundamentally different characteristics (energy and power capacities) and operation patterns, ensuring the balancing of renewable fluctuations at different timescales.*
