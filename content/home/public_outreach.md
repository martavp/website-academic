I participate in various initiatives and platforms aimed at fostering an informed and rigorous public debate on the energy transition. I am a member of the [Critical Energy Observatory](https://observatoriocriticodelaenergia.org/), the [Renewable Energy Foundation](https://fundacionrenovables.org/) and [ONGAWA, Technology for Human Development](https://ongawa.org/).
I have published several articles in the press, a TEDx talk, reports to explain the operation of the electricity market in Spain and several other topics. A complete list can be obtained [here](uploads/Public_Outreach_Marta_Victoria.pdf).
