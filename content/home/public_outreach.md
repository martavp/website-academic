I participate in various initiatives and platforms aimed at fostering an informed and rigorous public debate on the energy transition. I am a member of the [Critical Energy Observatory](https://observatoriocriticodelaenergia.org/), the [Renewable Energy Foundation](https://fundacionrenovables.org/) and [ONGAWA, Technology for Human Development](https://ongawa.org/).
I have published several articles in press, delivered a [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh4RspPF6Ew), co-authored a [report to explain the operation of the electricity market in Spain](http://observatoriocriticodelaenergia.org/files_download/Entiende_el_mercado_electrico.pdf) and several other topics. A [complete list of my public outreach activities](uploads/Public_Outreach_Marta_Victoria.pdf) is also available.
