I participate in various initiatives and platforms aimed at fostering an informed and rigorous public debate on the energy transition. I am a member of the [Critical Energy Observatory](https://observatoriocriticodelaenergia.org/), and I collaborate with the [Renewable Energy Foundation](https://fundacionrenovables.org/) and [ONGAWA, Technology for Human Development](https://ongawa.org/).

I have published several articles in press, delivered a [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh4RspPF6Ew), and co-authored a widely recognized [report explaining the operation of the power markets for the general public](https://observatoriocriticodelaenergia.org/files_download/Entiende_el_mercado_electrico.pdf). In 2021, I was one of the 100 experts selected by the Spanish Government’s Foresight Office to collaborate on the national strategy [España 2050](https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/presidente/actividades/Documents/2021/200521-Estrategia_Espana_2050.pdf), co-authoring Chapter 4 on achieving a climate-neutral and sustainable society. In 2025, I coauthored the book [Un lugar al que llegar. Mapa político de la transición energética](https://levantafuego.com/producto/un-lugar-al-que-llegar-mapa-politico-de-la-transicion-energetica/).
