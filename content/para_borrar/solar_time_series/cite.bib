	abstract = {Abstract Long-term hourly time series representing the photovoltaic ({PV}) generation in European countries have been obtained and made available under open license. For every country, four different {PV} configurations, ie, rooftop, optimum tilt, tracking, and delta have been investigated. These are shown to have a strong influence on the hourly difference between electricity demand and {PV} generation. To obtain {PV} time series, irradiance from {CFSR} reanalysis dataset is converted into electricity generation and aggregated at country level. Prior to conversion, reanalysis irradiance is bias corrected using satellite-based {SARAH} dataset and a globally applicable methodology. Moreover, a novel procedure is proposed to infer the orientation and inclination angles representative for {PV} panels based on the historical {PV} output throughout the days around summer and winter solstices. A key strength of the methodology is that it does not rely on historical {PV} output data. Consequently, it can be applied in places with no existing knowledge of {PV} performance.},
