Here, we proposed a method to convert irradiance data from reanalysis into solar generation time series and validated them using historical data. The model was used to produce long-term time series for 30 European countries that are used as input for large-scale energy models. The [time series](10.5281/zenodo.2613651) were released under an open-license and the paper was selected for [the cover of the July 2019 issue of Progress in Photovoltaics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1099159x/2019/27/7).
